For this assignment, I felt I did a decent job of meeting the grading requirements. 

I have three main game objects: Two snakes and an apple.
The two snakes are animated and move freely of one another. Both snakes detect collision
with the apples as well as the borders of the canvas. More so, the black snake will detect
a collision with any part of it's own array. These snakes are controlled using Keyboard Events
and react accordingly. (Arrows for black, WASD for purple)

The game itself isn't terribly too complex, which is why I added the twist of the second snake,
and also the option for a competitive or cooperative gameplay depending on the player(s). I felt
that this added to the game, made is unique, but also added another level of complexity. I had to
now manage having a minimal array length, apple color detection, and expanding the code to let 
only one snake move freely through itself as opposed to both.

To be entirely honest, I felt this took me too long to do. I'm not a particularly quick or gifted
coder, I just keep hitting my head against the wall until I eventually get something done. I'd be 
quite content with about a 70. While I feel like I put forth the effort for a much better grade, 
I realize that this feat isn't technically impressive, or graphically outstanding. My peers will
no doubt have created much more stunning projects, but I'm proud of what I managed to do.
