The two files present for the game should be 'snake.html' and 'snake.js'.

I initially tried to make the javascript inside of the html, but as the code
got more and more robust it was just easier to make it an external js file. That being said,
I could never get the linking between the two to work, and as time ran out I felt that 
was just a shortcoming I'd have to figure out for another project. 

In order to run this program, I recommend using an interactive IDE or using one online. On my laptop,
I use liveweave.com, as it allows for CSS, HTML, and Javascript development simultaneously while also
giving you a real-time demo. More so, it allows you to save to their cloud and also backs up your work
occasionally so that if your internet cuts out, freezes, or your computer crashes not everything is lost.
While it is a hassle, copying the html and js files into Liveweave would allow you to at least see the work
that I've done and hopefully have fun playing around with it. I added music to the game from "Snake, Rattle and Roll",
and old game from when I was little that was sort of my initial inspiration for the game. I changed the color scheme 
to be red and black since I didn't feel orange and purple would go over too well. If the sound doesn't work, it means the
dropbox link has changed. If you e-mail me, I'd be happy to provide the newest dropbox link for the aesthetic of the sound.

In the event it doesn't work on LiveWeave, create a reference in the html file to the gooleapis for jquery.
